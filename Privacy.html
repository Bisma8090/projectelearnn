            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>StudyEmber values the privacy of its users and is committed to protecting their personal and confidential information. This Privacy Policy outlines our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing your information.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>StudyEmber collects personal and confidential information necessary for providing and improving our services. We ensure that any information received will never be sold or redistributed to anyone.</p>
            
            <h2>2. Security Measures</h2>
            <p>Your information is safeguarded by a password and various technical, administrative, and physical security mechanisms. We employ coding practices to protect against attacks from web browsers and malicious scripts, processing all actions through several permission verification checks.</p>
            
            <h2>3. Protecting Your Account</h2>
            <p>You can help protect your account and personal information by selecting a strong password and limiting access to your computer and browser. Always sign off after accessing your account to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
            
            <h2>4. Document Security</h2>
            <p>Sensitive documents uploaded during the registration process are secured using international standards for data protection. These documents are encrypted both in transit (using TLS) and at rest (using authenticated encryption AES-GCM) to ensure data integrity and prevent compromise.</p>
            
            <h2>5. Payment Information</h2>
            <p>When you enter sensitive payment information (such as credit/debit card numbers) during our credit purchasing process, we encrypt the transmission using TLS technology. We do not store any credit card information; it is securely processed directly by our payment gateway service provider.</p>
            
            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
