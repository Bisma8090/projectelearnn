            <h2> Online Courses</h2>
            <p>We offer online courses of two types, self-paced and instructor-led.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Self-paced courses are all free and do not have any age limit.</li>
                <li>Instructor-led courses may have minimum age limits. Some courses are not offered without parent’s or guardian’s consent. Your parent or guardian, teacher, or StudyEmber administrator can view all information within or associated with your Platform account, including, without limitation, messages between you and your teacher and grades you received on assignments. Please know that misrepresenting your age, gender or uploading wrong ID documents is illegal and will result in your account suspended.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Payment</h2>
            <p>Some courses have recurring payments. We do not directly charge our customers their Credit/Debit card or any other payment methods; instead we send them invoice again. All invoices have a validity period after which student enrollment in a course will be suspended.</p>
            <p>We allot dedicated teachers for all paid courses within limited time slots so we do not offer any refund after the registration period is ended.</p>
